# ContieroCellar
A REST service in Spring that controls CRUD operations on MySQL table.

## Why are we doing this?

The aim of this project is to fulfil the requirements for the completion of QA Academy Bootcamp. 

The objective is to create a Spring Boot REST API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training.
